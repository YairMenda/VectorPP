## Iteration 1 - Python package with VectorPPClient class
- What was implemented:
  - Created VectorPPClient class with insert(), search(), delete() methods
  - Created SearchResult dataclass for search results
  - Created exception hierarchy: VectorPPError, ConnectionError, DimensionMismatchError, VectorNotFoundError, CapacityExceededError
  - Created __init__.py exporting all public classes
  - Added context manager support (with statement)
  - Auto-connect feature when methods are called

- Files changed:
  - python/vectorpp/__init__.py (created)
  - python/vectorpp/client.py (created)
  - python/vectorpp/vectordb_pb2_grpc.py (fixed relative import)
  - python/tests/test_client.py (created - 13 tests)

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The protobuf generated file (vectordb_pb2_grpc.py) had a direct import that needed to be changed to a relative import for package use
  - Protobuf uses 32-bit floats, so test assertions need almostEqual for float comparisons
  - The VectorDBStub class from the generated code is what wraps the gRPC channel
---

## Iteration 2 - Methods: insert, search, delete
- What was implemented:
  - Verified that insert(), search(), and delete() methods were already implemented in Iteration 1
  - Methods have correct signatures: insert(vector, metadata) -> id, search(vector, k) -> results, delete(id) -> bool
  - All 13 tests pass

- Files changed:
  - No changes needed - methods already implemented

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The PRD.md task was not marked complete even though it was implemented in the previous iteration
  - Always verify test status before marking tasks complete
---

## Iteration 3 - Connection to server via host:port configuration
- What was implemented:
  - Verified this feature was already implemented in Iteration 1
  - VectorPPClient accepts host and port parameters in __init__
  - Defaults to localhost:50051
  - test_custom_host_port test validates this functionality

- Files changed:
  - No changes needed - feature already implemented

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Multiple PRD tasks were implemented together in Iteration 1 but only one was marked complete
  - The client.py constructor on line 58 shows: `def __init__(self, host: str = "localhost", port: int = 50051)`
