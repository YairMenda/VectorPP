## Iteration 1 - Interactive Movie Search (US-008)
- What was implemented: Added comprehensive tests for the interactive_mode function in movie_demo.py to verify the interactive search feature
- The interactive search feature was already fully implemented in movie_demo.py (lines 324-381)
- Files changed:
  - python/tests/test_movie_demo.py - Added TestInteractiveMode class with 10 new tests
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The movie_demo.py already has a complete implementation of interactive search
  - interactive_mode supports commands: quit/exit/q, genre:<name>, top:<n>
  - Default top_k is 5 results
  - Timing is displayed in milliseconds (Embedding, Search, Total)
  - Tests use unittest.mock.patch to simulate user input
