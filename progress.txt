## Iteration 1 - Interactive Movie Search (US-008)
- What was implemented: Added comprehensive tests for the interactive_mode function in movie_demo.py to verify the interactive search feature
- The interactive search feature was already fully implemented in movie_demo.py (lines 324-381)
- Files changed:
  - python/tests/test_movie_demo.py - Added TestInteractiveMode class with 10 new tests
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The movie_demo.py already has a complete implementation of interactive search
  - interactive_mode supports commands: quit/exit/q, genre:<name>, top:<n>
  - Default top_k is 5 results
  - Timing is displayed in milliseconds (Embedding, Search, Total)
  - Tests use unittest.mock.patch to simulate user input
---

## Iteration 2 - Displays Similarity Scores and Response Time (US-008)
- What was implemented: Verified that similarity scores and response time display was already implemented
- Files changed:
  - PRD.md - Marked task as complete
- Implementation details:
  - search_similar_movies() function at line 266-321 handles the display
  - Similarity scores: displayed at line 317 as "Similarity: {score:.4f}"
  - Response time: displayed at line 311 with Embedding, Search, and Total times in milliseconds
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The search_similar_movies function is the core display function
  - Timing is captured using time.time() and converted to milliseconds
  - Tests test_search_similar_movies_success and test_interactive_mode_displays_timing verify this functionality
---

## Iteration 3 - Demo End-to-End Performance (US-008)
- What was implemented: Added TestEndToEndPerformance test class with 4 tests to verify demo completes in under 1 minute (excluding embedding generation)
- Files changed:
  - python/tests/test_movie_demo.py - Added TestEndToEndPerformance class with 4 new tests
  - PRD.md - Marked task as complete
- Test coverage includes:
  - test_demo_end_to_end_under_one_minute: Full workflow with 1000 movies, 10 search queries, interactive mode (asserts < 60s)
  - test_demo_insert_throughput_meets_target: Verifies insert throughput > 100 movies/sec
  - test_demo_search_latency_acceptable: Verifies average search latency < 100ms
  - test_demo_workflow_with_sample_data_fast: Quick workflow with 20 movies (asserts < 5s)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Mock embeddings to exclude embedding generation time from performance tests
  - Use generate_sample_movies() * 50 to simulate 1000 movie dataset
  - All tests pass in ~0.2s total, demonstrating the demo architecture is highly performant
  - The demo workflow (excluding embeddings) can handle 1000 movies with ease
