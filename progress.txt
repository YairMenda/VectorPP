## Iteration 1 - US-006: All RPCs are unary (simple request/response)
- What was implemented: Verified that all gRPC RPCs follow the unary pattern (single request, single response)
- Files reviewed (no changes needed - already correct):
  - proto/vectordb.proto: All 3 RPCs use unary pattern (Insert, Search, Delete)
  - src/server/service_impl.hpp/cpp: Implementation uses standard unary method signatures
- Tests verified:
  - 59 vector store tests PASSED
  - 11 config loader tests PASSED
  - 16 thread pool tests PASSED
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - gRPC is not yet installed in vcpkg (vcpkg lock issue), but core tests still run from previous build
  - Build outputs exist in build/Release/ directory
  - Use /c/VectorPP path format in bash (Git Bash on Windows)
