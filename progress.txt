## Iteration 1 - Interactive Movie Search (US-008)
- What was implemented: Added comprehensive tests for the interactive_mode function in movie_demo.py to verify the interactive search feature
- The interactive search feature was already fully implemented in movie_demo.py (lines 324-381)
- Files changed:
  - python/tests/test_movie_demo.py - Added TestInteractiveMode class with 10 new tests
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The movie_demo.py already has a complete implementation of interactive search
  - interactive_mode supports commands: quit/exit/q, genre:<name>, top:<n>
  - Default top_k is 5 results
  - Timing is displayed in milliseconds (Embedding, Search, Total)
  - Tests use unittest.mock.patch to simulate user input

## Iteration 2 - Displays Similarity Scores and Response Time (US-008)
- What was implemented: Verified that similarity scores and response time display was already implemented
- Files changed:
  - PRD.md - Marked task as complete
- Implementation details:
  - search_similar_movies() function at line 266-321 handles the display
  - Similarity scores: displayed at line 317 as "Similarity: {score:.4f}"
  - Response time: displayed at line 311 with Embedding, Search, and Total times in milliseconds
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The search_similar_movies function is the core display function
  - Timing is captured using time.time() and converted to milliseconds
  - Tests test_search_similar_movies_success and test_interactive_mode_displays_timing verify this functionality
