## Iteration 1 - Python package with VectorPPClient class
- What was implemented:
  - Created VectorPPClient class with insert(), search(), delete() methods
  - Created SearchResult dataclass for search results
  - Created exception hierarchy: VectorPPError, ConnectionError, DimensionMismatchError, VectorNotFoundError, CapacityExceededError
  - Created __init__.py exporting all public classes
  - Added context manager support (with statement)
  - Auto-connect feature when methods are called

- Files changed:
  - python/vectorpp/__init__.py (created)
  - python/vectorpp/client.py (created)
  - python/vectorpp/vectordb_pb2_grpc.py (fixed relative import)
  - python/tests/test_client.py (created - 13 tests)

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The protobuf generated file (vectordb_pb2_grpc.py) had a direct import that needed to be changed to a relative import for package use
  - Protobuf uses 32-bit floats, so test assertions need almostEqual for float comparisons
  - The VectorDBStub class from the generated code is what wraps the gRPC channel
